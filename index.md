Cheng Xu is now working as an Associate Professor in [School of Computer & Communication Engineering](http://scce.ustb.edu.cn/), [University of Science & Technology Beijing](https://www.ustb.edu.cn).

He is with the Microarchitecture and Integrated Circuit Laboratory (MICL). His research interests are in the areas of 

* **wireless indoor localization**, including channel modelling, localization estimation and tracking, cooperative localization and mobile computing; 

* **swarm intelligence and multi-robots system**, including cooperative localization, formation, target discovery and area coverage algorithms in swarm intelligence research.

* **human activity recognition**, including accurate human motion capture and behavior recognition.

**Expected graduate students**: I am looking forward to outstanding undergraduates who are committed to swarm intelligence robot, deep learning and reinforcement learning. Those with good programming skills or solid mathematical background would be preferred.
