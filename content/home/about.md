XXXXXXXXXX

I am a member of the [HiPEAC Network of Excellence] (http://www.hipeac.net/). 


Previously, I was a senior lecturer (~UK associate professor) in the [School of Computing and Communications](http://www.scc.lancs.ac.uk) at [Lancaster University] (http://www.lancaster.ac.uk) where I led the [Distributed Systems Resarch Group] (http://www.lancaster.ac.uk/scc/research/distributed-systems).

July, 2019: I have two fully funded PhD studentships available for Home/EU and International Students. Being an advisor to students is the best part of my job. Have a look at my research interests and recent publications. If any of those grab you, send me with a CV and a short text describing your background.  Please read [here] (phd.html) before apply.
